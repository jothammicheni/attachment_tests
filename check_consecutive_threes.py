QUESTION FIVE

Design a function that takes a list of integers as input. The function should
return True if the list contains two consecutive threes (3 next to a 3) anywhere
within the list. Otherwise, it should return False. For example, the function
should return True for [1, 3, 3] and False for [1, 3, 1, 3].
